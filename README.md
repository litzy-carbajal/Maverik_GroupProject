# Maverik Forecasting Time Series Analysis
**Capstone Group Project Fall 2023**

## Business Problem Statement   
Maverik is currently facing a significant challenge in preparing comprehensive ROI documents for their new store openings. This challenge stems from the difficulty of accurately predicting first-year sales, which in turn hinders the company's strategic financial planning and decision-making processes, ultimately affecting their sustainable growth. To address this issue, the primary analytical goal is to develop a predictive model capable of providing precise daily forecasts for merchandise sales, food sales, unleaded fuel sales, and diesel fuel sales for new Maverik stores during their first year of operation.
